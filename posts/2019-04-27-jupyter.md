[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/about), or officially Project Jupyter, is an open-source
project aimed to support interactive data science and scientific computing across
all programming languages.

In this post I'll go through my favorite setup for JupyterLab, a browser based
interactive IDE born out of the Jupyter Project.

## Dependencies
Make sure the following are installed:
- Git ([install on Windows](https://andrewmeier.dev/win-dev#git)
- Node ([install on Windows](https://andrewmeier.dev/win-dev#node))
- Python ([install on Windows](https://andrewmeier.dev/win-dev#python))
- Pipenv ([install on Windows](https://andrewmeier.dev/win-dev#pipenv))

## Setup
This next section will go through my opinionated setup for JupyterLab.
It covers some of the features of JupyterLab that I have found to make it
easier to launch the application, develop notebooks, and collaborate.

### Repository
Storing notebooks in GitHub is a great way to keep track of your work
and share your work with others. GitHub can render the notebooks and
markdown which makes it easy to browse and view notebooks from anywhere.
A great example repository can be found at 
[https://github.com/sinclam2](https://github.com/sinclam2).

First, create a new repository. If you are using GitHub, click the 'New'
button on the 'Repositories' tab.

Next, copy the repository URL.

![clone-repository](clone-repository.png)

Then clone the repository.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/<username>/notebooks.git
```

Create a file called `.gitignore` in the cloned repo with the following content:
```text
# Vim
*~

# Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# C extensions
*.so

# Jupyter Notebook
.ipynb_checkpoints

# Pipenv
Pipfile.lock

# Environment
.env

# Node
node_modules
```

### Pipenv
[Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a great package manager
for Python which makes it easy to set up projects and manage virtual environments.

Create a new virtual environment in your repository directory created above.
```shell
pipenv --python 3.7
```
> This will create a new Python virtual environment located in ~/.venvs/<name>.
It will also create a new file named `Pipfile` which will track the Python
dependencies.

### Jupyter
Install JupyterLab.
```shell
pipenv install jupyterlab
```

Start JupyterLab.
```shell
pipenv run jupyter lab
```
> Your default browser should open the jupyter lab URL.

You should now see the JupyterLab IDE in your browser window! :tada:

### Jupyter Config
Generate the Jupyter config which we will use to customize Jupyter.
```shell
pipenv run jupyter lab --generate-config
Writing default config to: "C:\Users\andy\.jupyter\jupyter_notebook_config.py"
```

Find the `c.NotebookApp.browser` setting and add the following:
```python
## Specify what command to use to invoke a web browser when opening the notebook.
#  If not specified, the default browser will be determined by the `webbrowser`
#  standard library module, which allows setting of the BROWSER environment
#  variable to override it.
c.NotebookApp.browser = 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe --app=%s'
```
> This tells Jupyter to open Chrome in app mode which makes for a better
experience when using JupyterLab.

You can always run with your default browser by start the application with:
```shell
pipenv run jupyter lab --browser=''
```

### GitHub Extension
The JupyterLab GitHub extension provides a clean way to browse and use notebooks
stored in other repositories. If you work with a team that uses Jupyter extensively,
this is a great way to collaborate.

Install the extension.
```shell
pipenv run jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/github
```
> Make sure you have the latest Node LTS version installed.
[Instructions for Windows](https://andrewmeier.dev/win-dev#node).

Install the server extension:
```shell
pipenv install jupyterlab_github
```

Next we need to generate a GitHub Personal Access Token so that calls to the GitHub
API are not rate limited. Navigate to your GitHub dashboard and then select 'Settings'
under your user dropdown.

![github-settings](github-settings.png)

Then in the left column select 'Developer Settings' and then 'Personal access tokens`.
Click the 'Generate new token' and store the token in a safe place (I recommend 1Password).

![personal-access-token](personal-access-token.png)

Open the generated config file from above and add the GitHub access token:
```python
# Configuration file for jupyter-notebook.

c.GitHubConfig.access_token = '< YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN >'
```
> There is not a section for GitHub so just add it at the top somewhere.

If you restart JupyterLab you should now see a GitHub tab which you can use
to browse repositories.

## Git Extension
The JupyterLab Git extension allows you to commit and push changes to your
repository without having to leave the application.

Install the extension.
```shell
pipenv run jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/git
```

Install and enable the server extension.
```shell
pipenv install jupyterlab-git
pipenv run jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab_git
```

Restart JupyterLab and you should see a new Git tab.

## Vim Extension
Optionally install the VIM extension. This makes it much faster to navigate
the notebook cells if you are familiar with VIM :zap:.
```shell
pipenv run jupyter labextension install jupyterlab_vim
```

Restart JupyterLab and you can now use VIM key bindings to navigate the cells
and edit code.

## Summary
In this post we covered installing JupyterLab and the GitHub, Git, and VIM
extensions. I hope you found the instructions helpful. If you have any questions
or if you run into any issues let me know in the comments below :point_down:.
